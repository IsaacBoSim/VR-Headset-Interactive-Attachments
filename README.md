# VR-Headset-Interactive-Attachments

Run the VR-Headset-Attachment Arduino code on the Arduino IDE. This will allow the VR headset to be able to interact with the game.

## Using Pre Patterns
1. Download the CSV file from the `Pre-Patterns` folder.
2. Download the corresponding video from `Pre-Pattern-Video` folder.
2. Open the `VR-Headset-Attachment Pre-Pattern` Arduino code in the Arduino IDE.
3. Copy the contents of the CSV file and paste it into the `pattern` array in the Arduino code.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino.
5. Press the start button on the Arduino and video in sync.

## Creating Custom Patterns
1. Open the `VR-Headset-Attachment Custom-Pattern` Arduino code in the Arduino IDE.
2. Create a new pattern by following the pattern format in the Arduino code.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino.
4. Press the start button on the Arduino and video in sync.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to create more patterns.
